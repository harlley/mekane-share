# Contributing to Mekane Share

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mekane Share! This is an experimental project focused on learning AI-assisted development with professional software engineering practices.

## Project Status

**Version: 0.0.1-alpha (In Development)**

This project is an experimental learning initiative to explore AI-assisted software development using professional practices and standards. I'm using this project to learn how to develop software with the assistance of AI agents while maintaining professional development workflows, code quality, and project management.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and considerate of others when contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mekane-share.git`
3. Create a branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add some feature"`
7. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Open a pull request

## Development Environment

Make sure you have:
- Node.js v23.6.0 or higher
- npm v11.2.0 or higher

## Project Structure

- `apps/extension`: Chrome extension (React/WXT/TypeScript)
- `apps/backend`: Backend service (TypeScript/Hono)
- `packages/shared`: Shared utilities and types

## Development Workflow

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm run dev`
3. For extension-only development: `npm run dev --filter=extension`
4. For backend-only development: `npm run dev --filter=backend`

## AI-Assisted Professional Development

This project serves as a case study for AI-assisted professional software development. If you're contributing, feel free to:

- Document how you used AI tools in your contributions
- Experiment with AI-assisted coding techniques
- Share insights about the AI-human collaboration process
- Demonstrate professional software engineering practices
- Implement industry-standard patterns and architectures
- Apply best practices for testing and code quality
- Contribute to CI/CD improvements

## Professional Standards

This project aims to maintain professional standards in:

- Code organization and architecture
- Testing and test coverage
- Documentation quality
- Git workflow and commit practices
- Code reviews
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the existing style
2. Update documentation if necessary
3. The PR should work in all supported browsers
4. Include screenshots for UI changes if applicable

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write tests for new features
- Keep commits small and focused
- Use descriptive commit messages

## Testing

- Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
- Run `npm run typecheck` to check for type issues
- Test your changes in Chrome before submitting

## Documentation

If you're adding new features, please update the relevant documentation.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue for discussion.
