## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project is an experimental learning initiative to explore AI-assisted software development with professional security practices. While this is primarily a learning project, security is taken seriously as part of demonstrating professional development standards.

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. **Open an issue** marked as "Security Concern" with details about the vulnerability
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full path of source file(s) related to the issue
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Impact of the vulnerability

## Professional Security Practices

As part of this experiment in professional development, we aim to implement:

- Regular security reviews
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secure coding practices
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Data protection measures

## What to expect

As this is an experimental project for learning purposes, response times may vary, but I will do my best to:

- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
- Address security concerns as part of the learning process
- Document how AI assistance was used to resolve security issues
- Apply professional security remediation practices

Thank you for helping make this experimental project better and more secure!
