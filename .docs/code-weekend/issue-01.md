## Code Weekend #1: Experimenting with AI-Driven Software Development

Last weekend I started a project to test the capabilities of AI-driven software development tools. I'm calling it "Code Weekend" - a practical experiment to evaluate how these new AI tools integrate into professional software development workflows.

### Why Code Weekend?

As experienced developers, we need to critically assess new technologies beyond the hype. Code Weekend is my methodical approach to testing AI coding assistants in a realistic project context, measuring their impact on productivity and code quality.

### Project Spotlight: Mekane Share

For this experiment, I'm developing "Mekane Share," a Chrome extension for screenshot capturing and sharing. I chose this project because it's:
1. Scoped appropriately for weekend work
2. Complex enough to test various aspects of development
3. Useful as a practical tool

My focus is on evaluating how AI tools perform across different development tasks:

1. **AI-Driven Development**: I'm systematically testing AI coding assistants across various development tasks - from project setup to issue creation to actual coding. I'm tracking where they excel and where they fall short.

2. **Professional Standards as Benchmark**: I'm maintaining professional standards throughout to evaluate if AI can truly support high-quality work:
   - Properly structured GitHub issues and templates
   - Clear technical specifications
   - Well-organized task breakdowns
   - Standard documentation

3. **Development Process**: I'm assessing how AI tools integrate with established development practices:
   - Version control workflows
   - Documentation generation
   - Code organization
   - Testing approaches

### Initial Observations

After the first weekend, I've noted several interesting patterns:

1. **AI as a Technical Assistant**: These tools show promise in handling routine aspects of development—generating boilerplate, organizing issues, and suggesting code structure—potentially freeing up time for more complex problem-solving.

2. **Limitations in Context Understanding**: The AI still struggles with deeper architectural decisions and project-specific constraints, requiring significant human guidance.

3. **Efficiency in Documentation**: One clear strength is in rapidly generating and formatting documentation, which typically consumes substantial development time.

### Following the Experiment

I'll be documenting this experiment through this column, sharing quantitative and qualitative observations about AI-driven software development. If you're interested in the project or findings, check out the repository at [github.com/harlley/mekane-share](https://github.com/harlley/mekane-share).

Have you experimented with AI-driven software development in your workflow? What metrics are you using to evaluate its effectiveness?
